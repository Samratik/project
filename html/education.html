                I began my academic journey at School No. 4 in Aktobe, where I studied from the age of 7. During my time
                there, I was actively involved in various activities and competitions that shaped my early educational
                experiences.
                Currently, I am pursuing my studies at SDU, having enrolled last
                year. This new chapter in my academic life has been filled with learning opportunities and personal
                growth.

                In addition to my academic and gaming achievements, I take pride in my ability to cook delicious meals.
                I believe that cooking is not just a skill but also an art that brings people together. My friends often
                enjoy my culinary creations, and I find joy in sharing my passion for cooking with them.
